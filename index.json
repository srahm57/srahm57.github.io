I am a devout developer (from the past 2 years). I often tell myself that I love Machine Learning! That\u0026rsquo;s because I hate probability and differential calculus. I will be completely honest in my blog. I don\u0026rsquo;t care whoever you are. I hated number theory too. I am not an enemy of linear algebra though. Thanks to Somnath sir, Rajan sir, Saifi sir\u0026hellip; and Gilbert ofcourse!\n I dont care whoever you are\u0026hellip; ~ Random Blogger\n Still survived my Machine Learning course in BITS and also did research for a year under one of the best profs in my campus. I went to his lecture on the Fundamentals of Data Science at 8am twice a week despite not being allowed enrol in it! I read most of the chapters from Bishop\u0026rsquo;s \u0026quot;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\u0026quot; book. Heck, it is beautiful! And it took some lectures from mitopencourseware to help me through my hatred of the fundamentals.\nDiligence is my thing. I am patient and persistant. Like a good donkey. Yes, I am quite self aware. To the point that I even hurt my confidence. I need to work on that. I think I took this quote way too seriously.\n When the going get tough\u0026hellip;\n \nHence, this blog. In this blog, I will just post whatever I learn. Very rarely, my opinions too. Please comment and guide me if I go the wrong way. I have taken many wrong turns and lost few good stuff in life. So, I am banking on you for the advice. Request you to not be unkind here. I get hurt fast.\n","date":1584554519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584554519,"objectID":"db2c395583a858dbdc3560de378bc21a","permalink":"https://srahm57.github.io/post/introduction/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T23:31:59+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/introduction/","section":"post","summary":"I am tempted to call this blog a journey, but my experience with myself refrains me from doing so.
